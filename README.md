# appInstall
A tool I created for installing application through SCCM

**5/13/2025 - Early Alpha**

This tool is still being developed.  You are free to use it anyway you like.  If you spot a bug or experience an issue please feel free to report it.  I will take a look and update the code.

## Purpose
To allow an engineer to install am application in a variet of formats with minimal configuration.  Sometimes customers ask for really weird features that are not in SCCM by default.  I started building this in an attempt to address this issue.

### Switches
-debug = Displays a bunch of data to help with troubleshooting a failure. ($True / $False or 1 / 0)
